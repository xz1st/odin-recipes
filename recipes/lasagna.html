        </ul>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop shallots and garlic, cut the carrots into small cubes and sauté everything in a pot with olive oil until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and fry, stirring occasionally, until crumbly. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Then add tomato purée and tomato paste. Cover and simmer over medium heat for approx. 15 – 20 min. Add oregano, basil, and thyme, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, preheat oven to 390°F/200°C. Turn on the convection setting if you have one. For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan. Add flour and cook until translucent, stirring constantly. Add the cold milk in portions and cook over high heat, stirring with a whisk until thickened. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom of a baking dish first with a layer of bolognese and then with lasagna noodles. Layer béchamel sauce on top. Repeat this process, finishing with béchamel sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan and Gouda cheese to taste and bake in the preheated oven at 390°F/200°C for approx. 35 min. until golden brown. Let cool for approx. 20 min. before serving. Enjoy!</li>
